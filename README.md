## Project Description
### What?
A Dapp to assist with event parking, commuter parking, paying, and reservations.  The idea is to make the process of finding a parking area much easier.  The app can help people avoid waiting in parking garages, or aimlessly looking for an available lot, and help them get to their location quicker.

### Why?
Experience with working in and commuting to the city has shown how antiquated and inefficient the parking process really is.  Especially if you would like to go to a concert or other event in the city, it can be hard to find a location.  SmartPark will help users find and pay for parking well ahead of time, and if anything causes a change in plans the parking can be released for another user.

### How?
SmartPark will be built on Ethereum network with smart contracts that can be deployed to the network. A simple web interface will be made to enable interaction between users and smart contract using various framework tools.

### Front End
HTML and Javascript (React)

### Back End
Web3js

### Tools
- Remix
- VS Code, Sublime, or Atom
- Git
- Google Drive

### Related Work
